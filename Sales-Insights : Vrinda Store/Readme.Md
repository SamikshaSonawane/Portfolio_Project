# Sales-Insights

# Situation
Vrinda Store aimed to construct an annual sales report for the year 2022, intending to gain a comprehensive understanding of its customer base and formulate strategies to enhance sales in the subsequent year.

# Task
The initial steps involved comprehending the dataset and meticulously examining each column. A crucial part of the process was identifying and addressing missing values within the dataset. Two categorical columns exhibited inconsistencies, with the terms "Women" represented as "W" and "Men" as "M." Similarly, another column posed a similar challenge with "1" denoting "One" and "Two" signifying "2." These discrepancies were rectified by standardizing the representations, replacing "W" with "Women," "M" with "Men," and "1" with "One" for clarity and consistency.

# Action
To facilitate further analysis, additional data processing steps were taken. Two new columns were introduced: "Month" and "Age Bracket." The former aimed at temporal analysis, while the latter categorized customers into age brackets, aiding in demographic insights.

# Insights
1. Women are buying more than men (~64%)
2. Maharastra, Karnataka, UP, Telangana and Tamil Nadu are the top 5 states by order ID.
3. Adult women in the age group of 27-28 contribute most to the sales.
4. The Top 3 channels are Amazon(35%), Myntra(23%) and Flipkart(22%).
5. Throughout the year a noticeable pattern emerges in the sales, with an increase at the beginning of the year and a subsequent decrease towards the end.
