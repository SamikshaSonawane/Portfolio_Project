# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Situation
As an entry-level data analyst, you are presented with a Bank Customer Churn dataset containing information about customers' interactions with the bank, including account details, transaction history, customer demographics, and whether they have churned or not.

## Task
My task was to analyze this dataset and provide insights into factors contributing to customer churn. The bank is interested in understanding the patterns and characteristics of customers who are more likely to churn. The ultimate goal is to develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates.

## Insights
1. Churn rate stands at 20.38%, with 2,038 customers out of 10,000 leaving.
2. Churn rates vary notably among demographics: France at 16.17%, Germany at 32.44%, and Spain at 16.67%
3. The chart highlights a peak in customer churn at the 6-month mark, with the lowest churn observed among customers who've been with the company for just 1 month. The orange line depicts this trend, showcasing the highest churn percentage at 6 months and the lowest at 1 month
4. A significant drop in customer numbers is observed as tenure extends from 8 to 10 years.
5. The gold-type card exhibits a low churn rate, while the diamond-type card has the highest churn rate among all card types.
6. The highest churn rate is observed among customers with 4 products, followed by those with 3 products, while customers with 1 product have the lowest churn rate.
7. Customers who are active and have no complaints are less likely to leave the bank.
8. The churn rate decreases as the number of points earned increases.
   
## Recommendation
1.  The company could also consider offering incentives to customers who have been with them for 6 months to encourage them to stay.
2.  The company could consider offering loyalty rewards to customers who have been with them for a certain length of time to encourage them to stay. Especially customer with 8 and above tenure.
3.  Enhance the customer support experience by prioritizing effective and timely resolution of complaints. Actively engage with customer feedback, making necessary improvements to continuously elevate satisfaction levels.
4. To optimize customer retention, strategic efforts are needed. Addressing challenges faced by customers with 4 products is essential, followed by initiatives to strengthen retention for those with 3 products.
