# Bank Customer Churn Analysis

## Situation
As an entry-level data analyst, you are presented with a Bank Customer Churn dataset containing information about customers' interactions with the bank, including account details, transaction history, customer demographics, and whether they have churned or not.

## Task

The bank is interested in understanding the patterns and characteristics of customers who are more likely to churn. The ultimate goal is to develop strategies to retain customers and reduce churn rates.
